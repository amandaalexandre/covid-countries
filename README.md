# covid-countries
An API consuming React app with Axios

## Current Issues
- Grid isn't as responsive as expected

## Future features
- Search country by name
- Buttons to filter results through regions
- Buttons to sort countries according to several parameters (highest deaths, highest recoveries, etc)
- Maybe include vaxx data
